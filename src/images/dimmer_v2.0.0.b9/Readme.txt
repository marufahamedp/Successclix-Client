Developed by: Nelson Pires

Description:
------------------------
The original eye saver app designed to provide brightness controls for
LCD/TFT/LED screens. Useful for working in low light conditions where
too much screen brightness is undesirable and bad for the eyes.
Saving the eyesight and eye strain of thousands of users since 2004.

It's a portable app:
 - runs without installation
 - simply delete the program file(s) to uninstall
   > note that you have to disable the option "Auto run" if enabled
     before deleting the program file(s), or, you'll be left with a
     reference to the program that you have to manually remove.

Special notes:
------------------------
- If the program fails to create the ini config file, you could be in a
privileged/protected folder. Run as Administrator or from another folder.

- When your monitors are not connected directly to your system graphics
card or motherboard (ie. through expansion cards, dongles, etc.), Dimmer
might not see them or correctly determine the its resolution. This should
be addressed in a future version.
