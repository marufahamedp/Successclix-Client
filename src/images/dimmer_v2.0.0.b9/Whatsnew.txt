Dimmer

What's new:



v2.0.0 b9 (14 Apr 2021)
------------------------

Special notes about this version:

- Beta 9 marks the end of the beta testing milestone.
- The app now works consistently well in over 95% of all reported cases, there are still issues especially with wrong screen boundaries and other annoyances that will be addressed in future versions.
- The next version will be a final v2.0.0 (no beta) and will have a new UI I've been working on for a while (creatively named as NelUI).
- Thanks to everybody that have submitted debug logs and information (sorry, couldn't respond to all), also a very special <thank you> to those that who donated or contributed with items from my Amazon wish list, it makes all the difference, thank you all.

Changes:

- [NEW] Option: Exit button hides to tray [popular request]
	\_> When enabled:
		> The exit/close button assumes the functionality of the minimise button
		> To exit the application, click on "Exit" in the tray context menu

- [NEW] It is now possible to access the taskbar from a hidden state (only when located at the bottom) [popular request]

- [NEW] The initialization file now has an .ini file extension (data is still in json format)

- [NEW] Option to show screen boundaries
	\_> Renders a 5px yellow border to what Dimmer sees as screen boundaries
	\_> Should help troubleshoot those edge cases where screens are not fully dimmed

- [FIX] Numeric screen identifiers were dimmed and hard to read in certain circumstances

- [FIX] The cursor/arrow keys could not be used to move the sliders



v2.0.0 b8 (31 Jul 2020)
------------------------

- [FIX (partial)] The issue with "index out of bounds" stems from the fact that the DeviceName was used to establish screen device order and count. I found a different way to set this but the order might still be incorrect, however, this is a major improvement and should solve this critical issue for a lot of people.

- [FIX] Touch devices no longer have the keyboard appearing when operating the sliders



v2.0.0 b7 (24 Jun 2020)
------------------------

- [FIX] Disabled sliders were still being interacted with by mouse clicks and mouse-wheel

- [NEW] New options in tray icon context menu

- [NEW] Debug log now includes the settings data file and any error messages

- UI refinements all around, more space, bigger buttons and better user experience



v2.0.0 b6 (21 Jun 2020)
------------------------

- [NEW] Options to minimize inconsistencies with the UI especially on systems with custom DPI values
	\_> PixelSnapping and LayoutRounding options are available for the app window and for every screen (can only be set in the JSON file)
	\_> Change these settings with the app unloaded, save and run the app again

- [NEW] Dimming slider now moves with the mouse-wheel for a more pleasant and expected behaviour

- [FIX] Any unsaved app settings would be lost if the app was forced to close in a system Logoff, Restart or Shutdown

- More debug parameters



v2.0.0 b5 (15 May 2020)
------------------------

- "LastRun" time value was not being set correctly

- Removed the experimental "Force dimming" option, it now happens automatically on the main dimming logic

	\_> Places a shortcut in the startup folder (per user)

	\_> To accomplish this before one would have to lower that screen to a zero value

- [BUG] Fixed a bug with the app sometimes not restoring to the front of other windows

- Minor startup logic optimizations

- Minor UI improvements

- [NEW] Debug tab containing data to help diagnose issues
	\_> The data aggregated here contains no private information and it's just the bare minimum OS and screen/display info
	\_> Send to developer will open your default email client and pre-fill all fields for your convenience

- [BUG] Fixed an issue where the json config file was having malformed data
	\_> This caused an "index out of range" error as reported by a number of people

------------------------

- Minor UI refinements

- Exceptions now have Ids to help find errors easier
	\_> Please provide feedback with these Ids
